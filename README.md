# hbf_phylesystem_test

This is a temporary repo of NexSON 1.2.1 to be used for testing the 
api.opentreeoflife.org. It will be removed when those tests complete
and the phylesystem repo is migrated to a sharded version in NexSON 1.2.1

This is a "model village" for testing. It is a subset of the phylogenetic studies that are synthesized into the
[Open Tree of Life](http://opentreeoflife.org) .
